Welcome to my Tasks Manager app! This Django-based web application allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. Users can view their current tasks, add new tasks, and even categorize tasks for weekends or special occasions. The app utilizes Django's session framework to store tasks temporarily. Whether you're organizing your daily routine or planning for special events, this app provides a user-friendly interface to keep you on track. Feel free to explore the code and contribute to the project!
